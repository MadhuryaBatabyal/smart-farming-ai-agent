# Smart Farming AI Agent

## Project Description
This project provides an AI-powered assistant designed to support small-scale farmers by delivering real-time, localized agricultural advice. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IBM Cloud Lite services with IBM Granite foundation models, the agent synthesizes trusted data from weather forecasts, soil conditions, crop recommendations, pest control measures, and local mandi market prices. It engages farmers in their native languages to reduce digital and knowledge barriers, enabling smart, data-driven farming decisions.

### Key Features
- **Real-time, location-specific guidance** on crop selection, pest and soil management, and market trends.
- **Multilingual conversational interface** tailored to farmers’ local languages.
- **Integration of multiple trusted data sources** for up-to-date and reliable recommendations.
- **Cost-effective and scalable deployment** using IBM Cloud Lite and AI models optimized for explainability and safety.

### Impact
This solution empowers grassroots farmers by bridging information gaps, reducing risks, improving crop yields, and enhancing income sustainability through actionable, accessible AI-driven insights.

### The primary end users for your AI-powered Smart Farming Advice agent are:
>Small-Scale Farmers: The main beneficiaries, these users receive actionable, localized advice in their native language. The agent helps them make informed decisions about crop selection, soil and pest management, and access to real-time market prices, directly improving their yield and income.

>Agricultural Extension Officers: These field workers and advisors use the AI agent to supplement their outreach programs, provide up-to-date recommendations, and address farmers’ queries more efficiently across regions or villages.

>Farmer Cooperatives and Self-Help Groups: Organizations and groups can use the platform collectively for planning, resource pooling, and price negotiations, enhancing their decision-making and market competitiveness.

>Agri-Entrepreneurs and Input Suppliers: Businesses that provide seeds, fertilizers, pest control products, and farm equipment leverage the agent’s insights for better customer support and supply planning.

>Local Governments and Policy Makers: Decision-makers access aggregated insights and trends from the agent’s usage data, helping them plan more effective interventions, subsidies, or regional advisories. The focus is on empowering underserved and digitally excluded communities, making advanced agri-advisory accessible, transparent, and locally relevant—right down to the grassroots.
