# Smart Farming AI Agent

## Project Description

This project provides an AI-powered assistant designed to support small-scale farmers by delivering real-time, localized agricultural advice. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IBM Cloud Lite services with IBM Granite foundation models, the agent synthesizes trusted data from weather forecasts, soil conditions, crop recommendations, pest control measures, and local mandi market prices. It engages farmers in their native languages to reduce digital and knowledge barriers, enabling smart, data-driven farming decisions.

### Key Features

- **Real-time, location-specific guidance** on crop selection, pest and soil management, and market trends.
- **Multilingual conversational interface** tailored to farmersâ€™ local languages.
- **Integration of multiple trusted data sources** for up-to-date and reliable recommendations.
- **Cost-effective and scalable deployment** using IBM Cloud Lite and AI models optimized for explainability and safety.

### Impact

This solution empowers grassroots farmers by bridging information gaps, reducing risks, improving crop yields, and enhancing income sustainability through actionable, accessible AI-driven insights.
